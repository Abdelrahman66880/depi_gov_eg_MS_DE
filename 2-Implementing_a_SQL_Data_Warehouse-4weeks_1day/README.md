## 01 - ```WAREHOUSING```

>- FIRST STEP IN IMPLEMENTING WAREHOUSING SOLUTIONS, is to create a sql server, then we will create a database and later on after understanding the database work on the server we will create a warehousing solution

## 02 - ```ETL - USING SSIS PACKAGE```
Using what you have learned so far,

and with the help of tutorials from the World Wide Web (the Internet),

AND THE TUTORIAL:

[Create a project and basic package with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/lesson-1-create-a-project-and-basic-package-with-ssis?view=sql-server-ver16)
and maybe some help from our mutual friend, aka "GPT" ðŸ˜…,

implement an ```SSIS``` package solution to perform ETL to the ```"DW"``` server.

The package should run on any machine.

You have to deliver a full solution with no missing files.

The package should be ready to run and accomplish the desired task.

* ### ```REQUIREMENTS```
    * Two ```"*.dtsx"``` files work as standalone scripts:

    * ```"DataTransfer.dtsx"```
    * ```"LoadXMLData.dtsx"```
    * These files contain the ETL solution for the problem of transferring the data to the warehousing server.
